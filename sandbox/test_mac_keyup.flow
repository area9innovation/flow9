/*
	ISSUE: With certain keys combination, keyup events are not called.
	For instance, taking a screenshot with shift + cmd + 5:
	Both shift and cmd remains pressed until any key is pressed.
	A similar issue is reported here: https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/16128.
	Suggested workaround doesn't work in this case.
