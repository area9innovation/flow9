Flow: getting started (on Linux)
================================

Much of the information in this getting-started is created for Ubuntu 18.04,
so some of the operations may be different for your Operating System of
choice.

## Sample install script
The `.travis.yml` file at the root level of the Flow repository is used
on Travis-CI integration to install and configure Flow’s dependencies,
build the Flow compiler, and run the flowunit tests suite, all on Ubuntu
Linux. The commands in this file may be a useful guide for making the
same happen on your own Linux system.
# Environment configuration
All environment variables should be defined in `~/.profile`. This is
necessary since applications that are started from an application menu
(i.e., not started from the command line; e.g., emacs) will not see
environment variables defined in other files, such as `~/.bashrc`. In
some terminals, though, `~/.profile` is not considered during startup,
so as a compromise you can store variables in some file, which is
`source`'d in both `~/.profile` and `~/.bashrc`
```bash
touch ~/.env
echo "source ~/.env" | tee -a ~/.bashrc ~/.profile
```
Also it can be useful to define environment variables in .xsessionrc. This way they will be 
[enabled for any X session](https://askubuntu.com/questions/82120/how-do-i-set-an-environment-variable-in-a-unity-session)

# Backend
## MySQL
Set up MySQL and MySQL Workbench:
```bash
sudo apt install -y mysql-server mysql-client
```
Make root@localhost user with empty password:
```bash
sudo mysql --user="root" --execute="ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY ''; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"
```
Configure MySQL-server mode:
```bash
printf '[mysqld]
sql-mode=STRICT_ALL_TABLES,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER\n' | sudo tee -a /etc/mysql/my.cnf
```
More details on mysql setup can be found in `flow9/doc/mysql.markdown`

## PHP5.6
Set up PHP:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y php5.6 php5.6-mysql php-gettext php5.6-mbstring php-xdebug libapache2-mod-php5.6 php5.6-xml php5.6-zip php5.6-mcrypt
sudo update-alternatives --config php
```
## Apache2
Install and configure apache2:
```bash
sudo apt install apache2
printf 'Alias "/todoapp" "/home/'$USER'/area9/todoapp/www2/"
<Directory /home/'$USER'/area9/todoapp/www2/>
     AllowOverride All
     Require local
</Directory>\n' | sudo tee /etc/apache2/conf-available/area9.conf
sudo a2enconf area9
sudo service apache2 restart
```
Note that todoapp is name for application in exercise 9, you can rename it as you wish.
# Clone the repositories
If you haven't installed git yet, enter next commands:
```bash
sudo apt install -y git
git config --global user.email "<email for github account>"
git config --global user.name "<your full name>"
git config --global alias.hist "log --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --graph --date=format:'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'"
git config --global push.default simple
git config --global pull.rebase true
```
In order not to enter authentication data each time, follow the instructions described in [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/).

Make area9 dir:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/area9 && cd ~/area9
```
Clone flow9 repos:
```bash
git clone ssh://git@github.com/area9innovation/flow9.git
```

Notice, that flow9 repo requires installed [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com).
You have to reclone the flow9 repository after installing Git LFS, or use 
```bash
git lfs pull
```
# Install `Haxe`
Our build servers use haxe 3.2.1 and neko 2.0.0. Haxe 3.4.* should work.

A Linux installer is available here: [Haxe download
site](https://haxe.org/download/)

**Note** If you choose to use Linux package installer for Ubuntu, you
may encounter following problem:
`add-apt-repository: command not found`.\
In such case, run following command:
`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install software-properties-common`

After running the installer, run this:
```bash
printf 'export HAXE_STD_PATH=/usr/share/haxe/std
export FLOW=$HOME/area9/flow9
export PATH=$FLOW/bin:$PATH\n' >> ~/.env
```
and run `source ~/.env`.

If you have followed the installation instructions for Linux Package
installer, you have already set up Haxe library directory, so you don’t
have to do the next step.

Set up your Haxe library directory:
```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p ~/haxelib/lib
haxelib setup ~/haxelib/lib
```
Then install the required libraries:
```bash
haxelib install format
haxelib install pixijs 4.7.1 #(or a newer edition)
```
# Install `Neko`
Our build servers use haxe 3.2.1 and neko 2.0.0. Newer versions might
work as well, but it is not guaranteed.

**If the haxe installer above did not install Neko** or installed a wrong
version, you can do it manually either by downloading it from the
official site

    The [Neko download site](http://nekovm.org/download) offers both
    32-bit and 64-bit binaries.  Make sure your haxe and neko match. Most
    use the 32-bit version.

or via package manager like this:
```bash
sudo apt-get install neko
```
**Run this:**
```bash
printf 'export NEKOPATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/neko
export PATH=$NEKOPATH:$PATH\n' >> ~/.env
```
and run `source ~/.env`.

**NOTE:** if you have error “Uncaught exception - load.c(237) : Failed
to load library : std.ndll (dlopen(std.ndll, 1): image not found)” check
your real neko path and put it in NEKOPATH, it can be
/usr/local/lib/neko or another path.

Alexander Gavrilov offers:

LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH (Ubuntu)
--------------------------

The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable must include the path to
Neko. This is not done by explicitly setting this variable but by adding
an application-specific file to the `/etc/ld.so.conf.d` directory like
so:

Create the file `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/flow.conf` and add to it the path
    to Neko (/usr/bin/neko in Ubuntu). You can do this with:
```bash
echo '/usr/bin/neko' | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/flow.conf
```
Run
```bash
sudo ldconfig
```
If you get the following messages
```
 /sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/lib/nvidia-375/libEGL.so.1 is not a symbolic link
 /sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/lib32/nvidia-375/libEGL.so.1 is not a symbolic link
```
then the following solution works
```bash
sudo mv /usr/lib/nvidia-375/libEGL.so.1 /usr/lib/nvidia-375/libEGL.so.1.org
sudo mv /usr/lib32/nvidia-375/libEGL.so.1 /usr/lib32/nvidia-375/libEGL.so.1.org
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/nvidia-375/libEGL.so.1 /usr/lib/nvidia-375/libEGL.so.375.39
sudo ln -s /usr/lib32/nvidia-375/libEGL.so.1 /usr/lib32/nvidia-375/libEGL.so.375.39
```
Note that `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` will not actually contain the path to Neko,
but the system can now find libraries on that path nonetheless.
# Compile Flow itself
Neko version of flow from the repo should be fine but if you wish to compile your own, do:
```bash
cd ~/flow9/src
haxe FlowNeko.hxml
```
This should take a few seconds. If it takes more than a minute, very likely something is going wrong.
The following file will be created or overwritten:
```
flow9/bin/flow.n
```
# C++ runner (flowcpp)
Under linux it’s easier to compile yourself a binary instead of using
the precompiled one. To do so, you should have Qt 5.12.0 set up by default
Install required libraries:
```bash
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev -y
wget -q -O /tmp/libpng12.deb http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/libp/libpng/libpng12-0_1.2.54-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb \
  && sudo dpkg -i /tmp/libpng12.deb \
  && rm /tmp/libpng12.deb
```
Download and setup QT 5.12.0 (or later):
```bash
wget https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.12/5.12.0/qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.0.run
chmod +x qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.0.run
```
**Install into `<path to your home directory>/Qt/5.12.0` and be sure to select all items to install!**
```bash
./qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.0.run
rm qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.0.run
```

```bash
sudo apt install libpulse-dev libglu1-mesa-dev qtchooser -y
qtchooser -install qt512 ~/Qt/5.12.0/5.12.0/gcc_64/bin/qmake
echo "export QT_SELECT=qt512" >> ~/.env && source ~/.env
```
Clone asmjit repo:
```bash
cd $FLOW/platforms/common/cpp
git clone ssh://git@github.com/area9innovation/asmjit.git
cd asmjit
git checkout next
```
Build QtByteRunner:
```bash
cd $FLOW/platforms/qt
./build.sh # it can return with error 127, but that's expected
```
New QtByteRunner binary will appear in $FLOW/platforms/qt/bin/linux folder

Now you can run hello.flow using flowcpp:
```
cd ~/area9/flow9/
flowcpp sandbox/hello.flow
```
You should see:
```
Flow compiler (3rd generation)

Processing 'sandbox/hello' on server.
0.63s


Hello console
```

After that, the runner will hang, because the program doesn’t end with a
call to `quit(0)`, and the different runners aren’t consistent with each
other about what happens when `main()` ends without an explicit quit
call. You can ctrl-C out of it.

# fdb, the Flow debugger
The C++ runner can also be used in debug mode, which activates a
debugger with a GDB-like command line.

Wrapping the debugger in GNU Readline gives an improved experience with
line editing and command history. If you haven’t already, do:
```bash
sudo apt-get install rlwrap
```
Then an example invocation to run the debugger is:
```bash
rlwrap flowcpp --debug sandbox/hello.flow
```
At the `(fdb)` prompt, you can enter commands such as `step`, `next`,
and `continue`. The `help` command will show a list of all supported
commands.

The debugger can also be used within an editor. Because it mimics GDB,
it works with editors with gdb integration, for example Sublime Text
package. See [resources/sublimetext/readme.md](../resources/sublimetext/readme.md)
for more details.

# Try it (JavaScript in browser)
To compile Flow code to JavaScript, try e.g.
```bash
flowc1 sandbox/hello.flow js=www/hello.js
```
You should see:
```bash
Flow compiler (3rd generation)

Processing 'sandbox/hello' on server.
```
and `flow9/www/hello.js` should be created.

You might think to try the resulting JavaScript code with a command line
tool like Node or SpiderMonkey, but that will break. So you’ll need to
run it a browser.

A quick way to try that is:
```bash
xdg-open http://localhost/flow/flowjs.html?name=hello
```
Your browser should open and display a “Hello window” screen indefinitely and you look in the error console of your
browser and see:
```
"Hello console"
```

# Try it (Executed via apache, in browser)
Information on this topic can be found in platforms/qt/readme.md
in section "Enabling fast-cgi in apache"
# Tools
The auxiliary tools for Flow include a linter, a code formatter, and a
refactoring tool.

They can be run directly using `flow9/bin/lint.sh`.

These tools are also used by the Sublime Text and Emacs integrations.
(The editors also use `flow9/bin/autocomplete.sh` for autocompletion.)
# Profiling
The instructions in [development.markdown](development.markdown) for using the
Flow profiler should work fine on Mac as long as you have Java 8
installed.
