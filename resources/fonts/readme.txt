The roboto-glyphs.txt file is taken from SIL ViewGlyph in the Options -> View CMap dialog, selecting
everything and pasting it.

The program extractcodepoints.flow can convert that to the format used in the resourceroboto.xml
file.

The fonts.bat file in the root will prepare all fonts.

The fonts themselves come from here:
