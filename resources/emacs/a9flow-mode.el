;;; Commentary

;; Provides syntax highlighting, indentation support, compilation,
;; project navigation, and a few cute commands.

;;; Compilation
;;
;; The function `a9flow-compile' compiles given file
;;   (path should be relative to the specified root folder)
;; The function `a9flow-compile-project' compiles one of
;;   the projects you configured before
;;   For the information about project configuration see "Configuration" section
;; The function `a9flow-compile-project-ido' compiles one of
;;   the projects you configured before (with ido extension help if it's present)
;; During compilation process you can see its status in the mode-line
;; It there are some errors after compilation, output buffer will be opened.

;;; Running
;;
;; There are also functions for running projects.
;; The function a9flow-run-buffer runs current buffer with flowcpp
;; The functions a9flow-run-project and a9flow-run-project-ido run preconfigured project

;;; Navigation
;;
;;  You can use `M-.' to navigate to a function definition or an imported file
;;  `M-,' returns you back
;;  `M-;' takes you from function definition to it's body

;;; Stack
;;
;;  `a9flow-stack-yank' command will create a new buffer with flow-stack specific mode
;; Some shortcuts are present:
;;   S - show the line in the code (without window switch)
;;   G - goto the line

;;; Misc
;;
;; Also, you can yank a flow object string with a command `a9flow-object-yank'
;; it will be slightly formatted

;;; Configuration
;;
;; See a9flow-configuration-example.el
