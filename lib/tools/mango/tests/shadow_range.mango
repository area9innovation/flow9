// Problem: '0'-'9' includes '0'-'5'
ranges1 = '0'-'9' | '0'-'5';

// Problem: partial overlap
ranges2 = 'a'-'m' | 'f'-'z';

// Correct: Disjoint ranges

// Problem: string vs range
str_range = "a" | 'a'-'z';

// Problem: range vs string
range_str = 'a'-'z' | "apple";

// Start rule
ranges1 // Doesn't matter which rule we start with for analysis
