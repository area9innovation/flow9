# Mango

Mango is the third generation parser, after *Lingo* and *Gringo*.

Nice features include:

- Automatic type inference so you get types for the AST from the grammar alone
- Grammar functions & includes, so you can mix & match grammars
- Built-in fully turing complete stack language Poppy for semantic actions
- Export of VS Code plugins with syntax highlighting for your grammar

The following sections describe Mango in more detail.

The code for Mango resides in a separate repository. Ask Asger for access.
