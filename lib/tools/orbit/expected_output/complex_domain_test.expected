Created test graph with nodes:
a with ID: 1
b with ID: 2
a + b with ID: 5
Algebra with ID: 6
Type("number") with ID: 9
Group(a + b) with ID: 14
Adding domains to a + b
Added Algebra domain: 1
Added Type("number") domain: 1
Added Group(a + b) domain: 1
Testing simple domain matching
MATCH FOUND with Algebra at ID: 5
Bindings: [Pair("x", 3), Pair("y", 4)]
Total matches with Algebra: 1
Testing complex function domain matching
Total matches with Type("number"): 0
Testing nested domain matching
Total matches with Group(a + b): 0
Testing negative domain matching
NEGATIVE MATCH FOUND at ID: 5
Bindings: [Pair("x", 3), Pair("y", 4)]
NEGATIVE MATCH FOUND at ID: 13
Bindings: [Pair("x", 11), Pair("y", 12)]
Total negative matches: 2
Result: "Complex domain pattern test completed"
