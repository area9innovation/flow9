==== Testing DNF Canonicalization ====
Original: ((a ∨ b) ∧ (¬a ∨ c))
Rule 'special_dnf_case' applied. ID: 12: ((a ∧ c) ∨ (¬a ∧ b)) was ((a ∨ b) ∧ (¬a ∨ c)) at 8
DNF: ((a ∧ c) ∨ (¬a ∧ b))
Expected: ((a ∧ c) ∨ (¬a ∧ b))
Expanded form: (((a ∧ c) ∨ (b ∧ c)) ∨ (b ∧ ¬a))
Rule 'partial_dnf_simplify' applied. ID: 16: ((a ∧ c) ∨ (¬a ∧ b)) was (((a ∧ c) ∨ (b ∧ c)) ∨ (b ∧ ¬a)) at 12
Simplified: ((a ∧ c) ∨ (¬a ∧ b))
Result: "Done"
