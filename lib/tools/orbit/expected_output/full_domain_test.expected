Created test graph with nodes:
a with ID: 1
b with ID: 2
a + b with ID: 6
Algebra with ID: 7
Adding Algebra domain to a + b
Domain added: 1
Matching (x + y) : Algebra pattern:
MATCH FOUND at ID: 6
Bindings: [Pair("x", 4), Pair("y", 5)]
Total matches: 1
Matching (x + y) !: OtherDomain pattern:
NEGATIVE MATCH FOUND at ID: 6
Bindings: [Pair("x", 4), Pair("y", 5)]
Total negative matches: 1
Matching simple x + y pattern:
BASIC MATCH FOUND at ID: 6
Bindings: [Pair("x", 4), Pair("y", 5)]
Total basic matches: 1
Result: "Domain pattern test completed"
