=== BDD Advanced Features: Quantification and Model Counting ===
Test formula: ((a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c))
As BDD:
Ite(a, Ite(b, true, Ite(c, true, false)), false)
--- Variable Restriction ---
Formula with a=true:
Ite(b, true, Ite(c, true, false))
Simplified: (b ∨ c)
Formula with b=false:
Ite(a, Ite(c, true, false), false)
Simplified: (a ∧ c)
--- Quantification Operations ---
* Existential Quantification *
∃b.[(a && b) || (a && c)]:
Ite(a, true, false)
Simplified: a
∃a.[(a && b) || (a && c)]:
Ite(b, true, Ite(c, true, false))
Simplified: (b ∨ c)
* Universal Quantification *
∀c.[(a && b) || (a && c)]:
Ite(a, Ite(b, true, false), false)
Simplified: (a ∧ b)
∀a.[(a && b) || (a && c)]:
false
Simplified: false
--- Model Counting ---
Number of satisfying assignments for (a && b) || (a && c): 3
Number of satisfying assignments for a || b: 3
Number of satisfying assignments for !a && !b: 1
--- Finding Satisfying Assignment ---
A satisfying assignment for (a && b) || (a && c): Some([Pair(a, true), Pair(b, true)])
