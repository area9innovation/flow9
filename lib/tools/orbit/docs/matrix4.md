# Advanced Matrix Analysis in Orbit: Functions, Eigen-problems, and Lie Theory

## Introduction

This document expands on the foundational matrix concepts discussed in [`matrix1.md`](./matrix1.md), [`matrix2.md`](./matrix2.md), and [`matrix3.md`](./matrix3.md). It delves into more advanced analytical aspects of matrix algebra, focusing on how Orbit can represent, reason about, and optimize:

1.  **Detailed Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Problems:** Building on the initial introduction, exploring deeper properties and computational implications.
2.  **Matrix Functions:** Applying scalar functions (like exponential, logarithm, powers) to matrix arguments.
3.  **Introduction to Matrix Lie Groups and Lie Algebras:** Formalizing the connection between certain matrix groups and their associated algebraic structures.

Orbit's strength lies in using its symbolic rewriting engine, domain annotations, and group-theoretic canonicalization to manage the complexities inherent in these advanced topics.

## Detailed Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Analysis

As introduced in `matrix1.md`, for a square matrix `A`, the eigenvalue equation is `Av = λv`, leading to the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`. The solutions `λ` are eigenvalues, and the corresponding non-zero vectors `v` are eigenvectors.

```orbit
// Conceptual representation in Orbit
eigen_problem(A : Matrix<T,N,N>) → solution_set : EigenSolutionSet
	where solution_set contains pairs (λᵢ : Scalar<T>, vᵢ : Vector<T,N>)
	such that matrix_multiply(A, vᵢ) = scalar_multiply(λᵢ, vᵢ);

characteristic_poly(A : Matrix<T,N,N>, λ_var : Symbol) → determinant(matrix_subtract(A, scalar_multiply(λ_var, IdentityMatrix<N>)));

eigenvalues(A : Matrix<T,N,N>) → roots_of(characteristic_poly(A, default_lambda_var));
eigenvectors(A : Matrix<T,N,N>, λ : Scalar<T>) → null_space_vectors(matrix_subtract(A, scalar_multiply(λ, IdentityMatrix<N>)));
```

### Deeper Properties and Orbit's Handling

1.  **Similarity Invariance (Recap & Canonicalization):**
    If `B = P⁻¹AP`, then `A` and `B` have the same eigenvalues. The eigenvectors are related by `v_B = P⁻¹v_A`.
    ```orbit
	eigenvalues(matrix_multiply(matrix_multiply(P_inv, A), P))
		if is_inverse(P_inv, P) && is_invertible(P)
		→ eigenvalues(A) : GL_Conj_Invariant_Spectrum;

	// This rule ensures that the set of eigenvalues for similar matrices
	// can be canonicalized to a single representation in the O-Graph.
```

2.  **Diagonalization:**
    If an `N x N` matrix `A` has `N` linearly independent eigenvectors, it is diagonalizable. This means there exists an invertible matrix `P` (whose columns are the eigenvectors) and a diagonal matrix `D` (whose diagonal entries are the eigenvalues) such that `A = PDP⁻¹`.
    ```orbit
	// Domain for diagonalizable matrices
	DiagonalizableMatrix<T,N> ⊂ Matrix<T,N,N>;

	// Rule: If A is diagonalizable, relate it to its diagonal form.
	A : DiagonalizableMatrix → matrix_multiply(P_eigenvecs(A), matrix_multiply(D_eigenvals(A), P_inv_eigenvecs(A)));

	// Inference: A matrix with N distinct eigenvalues is diagonalizable.
	A where count(distinct(eigenvalues(A))) = N ⊢ A : DiagonalizableMatrix;
	// Real symmetric matrices are always diagonalizable by an orthogonal matrix.
	A : SymmetricMatrix<Real,N> ⊢ A : DiagonalizableMatrix where P_eigenvecs(A) : OrthogonalMatrix;
```
    Diagonalization is a powerful canonical form for certain operations, especially matrix functions.

3.  **Spectral Theorem:**
    For real symmetric matrices (`A = Aᵀ`), eigenvalues are real, and eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. Such matrices are always orthogonally diagonalizable: `A = QDQᵀ` where `Q` is an orthogonal matrix.
    For Hermitian matrices (`A = Aᴴ`), eigenvalues are real, and they are unitarily diagonalizable: `A = UDUᴴ` where `U` is a unitary matrix.
    ```orbit
	A : SymmetricMatrix<Real,N> → matrix_multiply(Q_ortho_eigenvecs(A), matrix_multiply(D_real_eigenvals(A), transpose(Q_ortho_eigenvecs(A))));
	A : HermitianMatrix<Complex,N> → matrix_multiply(U_unitary_eigenvecs(A), matrix_multiply(D_real_eigenvals(A), conjugate_transpose(U_unitary_eigenvecs(A))));
```
    Orbit can use these specific forms when the matrix domain is known.

4.  **Jordan Normal/Canonical Form:**
    Not all matrices are diagonalizable. Any square matrix `A` over an algebraically closed field (like Complex numbers) is similar to a Jordan matrix `J`, `A = PJP⁻¹`. `J` is block diagonal with Jordan blocks on its diagonal. Eigenvalues are on the diagonal of `J`.
    While symbolically computing `J` and `P` is complex, Orbit can use the *existence* of such a form or properties of Jordan blocks if provided or inferred.

5.  **Cayley-Hamilton Theorem:**
    Every square matrix `A` satisfies its own characteristic equation: `p(A) = 0`, where `p(λ) = det(A - λI)`. For example, if `p(λ) = λ² + c₁λ + c₀`, then `A² + c₁A + c₀I = 0`.
    ```orbit
	// Rule: A matrix satisfies its characteristic polynomial.
	// If char_poly_coeffs(A) = [c_n, c_{n-1}, ..., c_1, c_0] (for p(λ)=c_nλⁿ+...+c_1λ+c_0)
	// Then: c_n*matrix_power(A,n) + ... + c_1*A + c_0*IdentityMatrix = ZeroMatrix
	evaluate_polynomial_on_matrix(char_poly(A), A) → ZeroMatrix<N,N>;
```
    This can be used to simplify higher powers of `A` or express `A⁻¹` as a polynomial in `A`.

## Matrix Functions

Applying a scalar function `f(x)` to a square matrix `A` results in a matrix `f(A)`. This is well-defined for analytic functions (those with a convergent Taylor series).

1.  **Via Taylor Series Expansion:**
    If `f(x) = Σ aᵢxⁱ`, then `f(A) = Σ aᵢAⁱ` (where `A⁰ = I`).
    ```orbit
	// Example: Matrix Exponential
	matrix_exponential(A : Matrix<T,N,N>) →
		IdentityMatrix<N> + A + matrix_multiply(A,A)/2! + matrix_multiply(A,matrix_multiply(A,A))/3! + ... : TaylorSeriesExpansion;
	// Orbit would need rules for symbolic series manipulation and convergence criteria.
```

2.  **Via Diagonalization (Most Practical Symbolic Approach):**
    If `A` is diagonalizable, `A = PDP⁻¹`, then `f(A) = P f(D) P⁻¹`. `f(D)` is computed by applying `f` to each diagonal element of `D`.
    ```orbit
	// Rule: Apply function via diagonalization
	f(A : DiagonalizableMatrix) →
		matrix_multiply(P_eigenvecs(A), matrix_multiply(f_on_diagonal(D_eigenvals(A), f), P_inv_eigenvecs(A)));

	f_on_diagonal(D_diag : DiagonalMatrix, f_scalar_func) →
		diagonal_matrix(map(f_scalar_func, diagonal_elements_of(D_diag)));

	// Specific example for matrix_power
	matrix_power(A : DiagonalizableMatrix, k : Integer) →
		matrix_multiply(P_eigenvecs(A), matrix_multiply(matrix_power_diag(D_eigenvals(A), k), P_inv_eigenvecs(A)));
	matrix_power_diag(D_diag, k) → diagonal_matrix(map(λx. x^k, diagonal_elements_of(D_diag)));
```
    This is often the most effective way for Orbit to handle matrix functions symbolically.

3.  **Via Jordan Normal Form:**
    If `A = PJP⁻¹`, then `f(A) = P f(J) P⁻¹`. Computing `f(J)` involves applying `f` to Jordan blocks, which can be done using Taylor series for each block.

4.  **Exponentiation by Squaring for Matrix Powers (`Aᵏ`):**
    This is an algorithmic optimization rather than a matrix function definition, but crucial for computing powers efficiently. Orbit can represent this as a recursive rewrite strategy:
    ```orbit
	matrix_power(A, k : PositiveInteger) : RequiresMultiplication →
		if k = 0 then IdentityMatrix<N>
		else if k = 1 then A
		else if is_even(k) then matrix_power(matrix_multiply(A, A), k/2) // A^k = (A^2)^(k/2)
		else A * matrix_power(A, k-1); // A^k = A * A^(k-1)
```

## Introduction to Matrix Lie Groups and Lie Algebras

Certain sets of matrices form continuous groups (Lie groups) under matrix multiplication. These are fundamental in physics, geometry, and differential equations. Each Lie group has an associated Lie algebra, which is a vector space capturing the group's infinitesimal structure.

Orbit can define domains for these groups and algebras and use their properties for rewrites.

### Common Matrix Lie Groups and Their Algebras

1.  **General Linear Group `GL(n, F)`:** Group of `n x n` invertible matrices over field `F`.
    *   **Lie Algebra `gl(n, F)`:** Space of all `n x n` matrices over `F`. The Lie bracket is the matrix commutator: `[X, Y] = XY - YX`.
    ```orbit
	Matrix<T,N,N> ⊂ gl_algebra<T,N>; // All matrices form the algebra
	matrix_commutator(X,Y) → matrix_subtract(matrix_multiply(X,Y), matrix_multiply(Y,X));
```

2.  **Special Linear Group `SL(n, F)`:** Subgroup of `GL(n, F)` with `det(A) = 1`.
    *   **Lie Algebra `sl(n, F)`:** Space of `n x n` matrices with `tr(X) = 0`.
    ```orbit
	A : Matrix<T,N,N> where determinant(A) = 1 ⊢ A : SLnF_Group;
	X : Matrix<T,N,N> where trace(X) = 0 ⊢ X : slnF_Algebra;
```

3.  **Orthogonal Group `O(n)`:** Group of `n x n` real matrices `A` with `AᵀA = I` (or `A⁻¹ = Aᵀ`).
    *   **Lie Algebra `o(n)` or `so(n)`:** Space of `n x n` real skew-symmetric matrices (`Xᵀ = -X`). (Technically `so(n)` is the algebra for `SO(n)` but often used for `O(n)` as well).
    ```orbit
	A : Matrix<Real,N,N> where matrix_multiply(transpose(A), A) = IdentityMatrix<N> ⊢ A : On_Group;
	X : Matrix<Real,N,N> where transpose(X) = negate(X) ⊢ X : on_Algebra; // X is skew-symmetric
```

4.  **Special Orthogonal Group `SO(n)`:** Subgroup of `O(n)` with `det(A) = 1` (rotations).
    *   **Lie Algebra `so(n)`:** Same as for `O(n)` (skew-symmetric matrices).

5.  **Unitary Group `U(n)`:** Group of `n x n` complex matrices `A` with `AᴴA = I` (or `A⁻¹ = Aᴴ`).
    *   **Lie Algebra `u(n)`:** Space of `n x n` complex skew-Hermitian matrices (`Xᴴ = -X`).
    ```orbit
	A : Matrix<Complex,N,N> where matrix_multiply(conjugate_transpose(A), A) = IdentityMatrix<N> ⊢ A : Un_Group;
	X : Matrix<Complex,N,N> where conjugate_transpose(X) = negate(X) ⊢ X : un_Algebra; // X is skew-Hermitian
```

6.  **Special Unitary Group `SU(n)`:** Subgroup of `U(n)` with `det(A) = 1`.
    *   **Lie Algebra `su(n)`:** Space of `n x n` complex skew-Hermitian matrices with `tr(X) = 0`.

### The Matrix Exponential Map

The matrix exponential `exp(tX)` maps elements `X` from a Lie algebra to the corresponding Lie group (for scalar `t`).

```orbit
// Rule: Exponential map connects algebra to group
matrix_exponential(X : on_Algebra) : On_Group; // More specifically SO(n) if connected component
matrix_exponential(X : un_Algebra) : Un_Group;
matrix_exponential(X : slnF_Algebra) : SLnF_Group;
// exp(tX) for scalar t
matrix_exponential(scalar_multiply(t : Real, X : on_Algebra)) : SO_n_Group; // if X != 0
```
This allows Orbit to reason about transformations between these algebraic structures.

### Rewrite Rules Based on Lie Group/Algebra Properties

*   **Simplifying Inverses:**
    ```orbit
	matrix_inverse(A : On_Group) → transpose(A);
	matrix_inverse(A : Un_Group) → conjugate_transpose(A);
```
*   **Determinant Properties:**
    ```orbit
	determinant(A : SLnF_Group) → 1;
	determinant(A : SOn_Group) → 1;
	determinant(A : SUn_Group) → 1;
	determinant(A : On_Group) → result where result*result=1; // ±1
```
*   **Commutator Identities (for Lie Algebras):**
    Jacobi Identity: `[X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z, X]] + [Z, [X, Y]] = 0`.
    These can be used for simplifying nested commutator expressions.

*   **Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula (Advanced):**
    For `X, Y` in a Lie algebra, `log(exp(X)exp(Y)) = X + Y + 1/2[X,Y] + 1/12[X,[X,Y]] - 1/12[Y,[X,Y]] + ...`
    Orbit could store truncated versions of this formula to approximate or simplify products of matrix exponentials, especially when `X` and `Y` nearly commute.

## Conclusion
