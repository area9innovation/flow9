# Orbit's Approach to Probability Distributions for Program Optimization

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to integrate a comprehensive understanding of probability distributions into the Orbit rewriting system. By enabling Orbit to represent, analyze, and manipulate probabilistic information associated with program variables, expressions, and control flow, we aim to unlock advanced program optimization capabilities. This involves:

1.  **Symbolic Representation:** Defining how various probability distributions (including univariate and key multivariate ones) and their parameters are represented within Orbit's domain system. This is analogous to how different matrix types and their properties are defined (see [`matrix1.md`](./matrix1.md) and [`matrix2.md`](./matrix2.md)).
2.  **Inferential Reasoning:** Developing mechanisms for Orbit to infer the distributional properties of program elements (e.g., the result of an operation, the state after a conditional branch), leveraging the rich interconnections between distributions.
3.  **Rewrite Rules:** Creating a rich set of rewrite rules that operate on these distributions to simplify expressions, propagate information, recognize equivalences between distributions, and transform program structures based on probabilistic insights. This mirrors the rule-based optimization for matrix operations.
4.  **Optimization Applications:** Utilizing the inferred probabilistic knowledge to guide optimization decisions, such as branch prediction, function inlining, memory layout, speculative execution, and value range analysis.

Ultimately, this will allow Orbit to move beyond deterministic analysis and make more nuanced, data-driven (or model-driven) decisions to generate more efficient code. This series of documents will lay the groundwork for these capabilities.
