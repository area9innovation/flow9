# Canonical Forms and Group-Theoretic Rewriting in the O-Graph System

## Abstract

We present a unified approach to canonical forms and rewriting that uses group theory as its mathematical foundation. Our o-graph system extends e-graphs with domain annotations and group-theoretic properties, allowing diverse computational domains to share canonicalization strategies through a common framework. By leveraging symmetry groups like S₂, C₄, and D₄, we achieve exponential reduction in equivalent expression representations and enable automatic discovery of optimizations across domains. Through detailed examples spanning polynomial manipulation, matrix operations, and Boolean algebra, we demonstrate significant improvements in term representation compactness and transformation applicability. The system provides a principled approach to canonical forms that bridges theoretical mathematics with practical program optimization.

## 1. Introduction

### Problem Statement

Canonical forms—unique representations of objects within equivalence classes—are fundamental to computational systems. They enable equality testing, pattern matching, and transformational optimizations. However, traditional approaches to canonicalization create domain-specific solutions that cannot be easily transferred between contexts, leading to two key research questions:

1. How can we formalize canonical forms across diverse domains using a unified mathematical framework?
2. How can we efficiently represent and compute these canonical forms in practical systems?

The gap between theoretical canonicalization techniques and practical implementations becomes particularly evident in e-graph-based program optimization, where multiple equivalent representations of expressions must be managed efficiently without a principled approach to selecting canonical forms.

### Contributions

This paper makes the following contributions:

1. A formal framework for canonicalization based on group theory that provides a unifying mathematical foundation for diverse domains
2. An extension of e-graphs (o-graphs) that supports domain annotations and enables group-theoretic reasoning about canonical forms
3. A comprehensive set of rewrite rules for common symmetry groups (S₂, C₄, D₄) with formal guarantees of correctness
4. Empirical evaluation demonstrating significant reductions in representation size and improvements in optimization effectiveness

Our approach addresses the limitations of domain-specific canonicalization through three key innovations:

1. **Domain-annotated e-classes**: An extended e-graph implementation that supports domain annotations and hierarchies
2. **Group-theoretic canonicalization**: A systematic approach to deriving canonical forms using symmetry groups
3. **Cross-domain rewriting rules**: A powerful rule system that applies transformations based on algebraic structure

We demonstrate that many common symmetry patterns—commutativity, rotational invariance, permutation symmetry—can be represented using well-studied group structures that transcend specific domains, enabling knowledge transfer between mathematical structures and practical programming languages.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### E-Graphs and Equality Saturation

Equivalence graphs (e-graphs) provide an efficient data structure for representing congruence relations in term rewriting systems. Traditional e-graphs merge equivalent expressions into equivalence classes (e-classes) and maintain congruence invariants when new equivalences are discovered. Key implementations include:

- **egg** [1]: A widely-used implementation for equality saturation
- **egg-smol** [2]: A version optimized for reduced memory consumption
- **ReluVal** [3]: E-graphs applied to neural network verification

While these systems effectively represent equivalence relations, they typically lack mechanisms for defining domain-specific canonical forms or crossing domain boundaries.

### Group Theory and Canonicalization

Group theory provides a mathematical foundation for understanding symmetry. In computational contexts, several canonical form algorithms have been developed:

- **Canonical labeling algorithms** in GAP [7] and Magma [8]: For group-theoretic computations
- **Robinson-Sims algorithm** [9]: For canonical forms in permutation groups
- **Nauty** [10]: For canonical labeling of graphs under isomorphism

### Related Canonicalization Systems

Canonical form computation appears in multiple domains:

- **SMT solvers** [11]: Use canonical forms to simplify terms before proof search
- **BDDs** [12]: Provide canonical representations of Boolean functions
- **Computer algebra systems** [13]: Implement domain-specific canonicalization

Recent surveys on equality saturation [14] highlight the need for improved canonical form selection, but do not provide a group-theoretic framework for addressing this challenge.

## 3. O-Graph System

### 3.1 Extending E-Graphs

O-graphs extend traditional e-graphs with several key innovations:

1. **Domain membership**: Each e-class can belong to multiple domains, expressed through a "belongs to" relationship
2. **Root canonicalization**: The root of an e-class serves as the canonical representative
3. **Multiple e-node instances**: The system allows multiple instances of the same e-node with different e-classes
4. **Domain hierarchies**: Support for subsumption relationships between domains

### 3.2 Formal Syntax for Rewrite Rules

The o-graph rewriting system uses the following syntax (in BNF notation):

```
<rule>      ::= <pattern> '=>' <replacement> [<condition>] | <pattern> '<=>' <replacement> [<condition>]
<pattern>   ::= <expr> [':' <domain>] | <expr> '!:' <domain>
<expr>      ::= <const> | <var> | <app> | <op> <expr>* | <expr> <op> <expr>
<domain>    ::= <identifier> | <domain> '×' <domain>
<condition> ::= 'if' <predicate>
<predicate> ::= <expr> ('==' | '!=' | '<' | '>' | '<=' | '>=') <expr> | <func>(<expr>*)
```

This syntax supports pattern matching with domain constraints, negative domain matching, bidirectional rules, and conditional application.

### 3.3 Domain Annotations and Hierarchies

Domains are first-class entities in the system and can represent:

- **Mathematical structures**: (e.g., `Integer`, `Real`, `Field`, `Group`)
- **Types**: (e.g., `int`, `string`, `list<float>`)
- **Properties**: (e.g., `Associative`, `Commutative`, `Pure`)
- **States**: (e.g., `Canonical`, `Simplified`, `Processed`)

Domains can be organized into hierarchies:

```
// Mathematical domain hierarchy
AbelianGroup ⊂ Ring ⊂ Field;
Integer ⊂ Rational ⊂ Real ⊂ Complex;

// Symmetry group hierarchy
S₁ ⊂ S₂ ⊂ S₃ ⊂ ... ⊂ Sₙ;
C₁ ⊂ C₂ ⊂ C₃ ⊂ ... ⊂ Cₙ;
```

### 3.4 Implementation Data Structures

O-graphs are implemented using the following core data structures:

```
// E-node in the o-graph
struct ENode {
	op: Operator,          // Operation type
	children: [EClassId],  // Child e-class IDs
	domains: Set<DomainId> // Domain annotations
}

// Equivalence class
struct EClass {
	nodes: Set<ENodeId>,   // Equivalent e-nodes
	parent: EClassId,      // Union-find parent for merging
	domains: Set<DomainId>, // Domain annotations
	root: ENodeId          // Canonical representative
}

// Domain representation
struct Domain {
	name: String,
	parents: Set<DomainId>  // For hierarchy relationships
}
```

The system maintains a hash-consed table of e-nodes and unions e-classes when equivalence is established, while preserving domain annotations.

## 4. Group-Theoretic Canonicalization

### 4.1 Core Symmetry Groups

Our system formalizes several key symmetry groups that commonly arise in computation:

- **Symmetric Groups (Sₙ)**: Representing all possible permutations of n elements
  - S₁: Trivial group (identity only)
  - S₂: Group of order 2, represents commutativity (a + b = b + a)
  - S₃: Group of order 6, all permutations of 3 elements
  - Sₙ: Group of order n!, all permutations of n elements

- **Cyclic Groups (Cₙ)**: Representing rotational symmetry
  - C₁: Trivial group (identity only)
  - C₂: Group of order 2, represents 180° rotation
  - C₃: Group of order 3, represents 120° rotations
  - Cₙ: Group of order n, represents 360°/n rotations

- **Dihedral Groups (Dₙ)**: Representing rotational and reflectional symmetries
  - D₁: Group of order 2, represents reflection only
  - D₂: Group of order 4, represents 180° rotation and 2 reflections
  - D₃: Group of order 6, represents 120° rotations and 3 reflections
  - Dₙ: Group of order 2n, represents 360°/n rotations and n reflections

### 4.2 Group Actions and Orbit Calculation

Canonical forms are derived through group actions on expressions. When a group G acts on a set X, it partitions X into orbits. We select a canonical representative from each orbit using a consistent ordering criterion:

```
Orb(x) = {g·x | g ∈ G} // The orbit of x under group G's action
canon(x) = min(Orb(x))  // The canonical form is the minimum element in the orbit
```

#### Algorithm 1: Orbit-Based Canonicalization
```
function canonicalize(x, G):
	orbit = []
	for each g in G:
		y = apply(g, x)  // Apply group element g to x
		orbit.append(y)
	return min(orbit)    // Return the minimum element
```

The time complexity of naïve orbit enumeration is O(|G|·|x|), where |G| is the group size and |x| is the size of the expression. For large groups like Sₙ (with size n!), this is prohibitive. However, we can use specialized algorithms for each group type:

#### Algorithm 2: Symmetric Group Canonicalization (Sₙ)
```
function canonicalize_symmetric(elements, comparator):
	return sort(elements, comparator)
```

This reduces the O(n!) complexity to O(n log n) for sorting.

#### Algorithm 3: Cyclic Group Canonicalization (Cₙ)
```
function canonicalize_cyclic(array):
	n = length(array)
	min_rot = array

	for i in 1..(n-1):
		rotation = concat(subarray(array, i, n), subarray(array, 0, i))
		min_rot = min(min_rot, rotation)

	return min_rot
```

This has O(n²) complexity, but can be improved to O(n) using algorithms like Booth's [15].

### 4.3 Formal Correctness

The correctness of our canonicalization approach relies on the following theorem:

**Theorem 1**: *Let G be a finite group acting on a set X, and let ≤ be a total ordering on X. For any x ∈ X, the element min(Orb(x)) is a canonical representative of the orbit of x under G's action.*

Proof sketch: Since G is finite, Orb(x) is finite. The minimum element under a total ordering is unique, ensuring that the canonical representative is well-defined. Since all elements in Orb(x) are equivalent under G's action, choosing any consistent representative (such as the minimum) preserves the equivalence relation.

**Theorem 2**: *The canonicalization algorithms for specific groups (symmetric, cyclic, dihedral) correctly compute the minimum element of the orbit.*

Proof references for specific groups:
- For symmetric groups: See [15] for proof that sorting yields the correct canonical form
- For cyclic groups: See [16] for Booth's algorithm correctness
- For dihedral groups: See [17] for correctness of canonical forms under reflection and rotation

## 5. Rewrite Rules with Group-Theoretic Patterns

### 5.1 Basic Rewrite Rules

The system provides a powerful language for expressing rewrite rules with domain constraints:

```
// Simple rewrite rules
a + 0 => a : Canonical;               // Identity element elimination
a * 1 => a : Canonical;               // Identity element elimination
a * 0 => 0 : Canonical;               // Annihilator property

// Rules with domain constraints
a + b : S₂ => b + a : S₂ if a > b;     // Order terms by some criterion

// Rules with bidirectional equivalence
x * (y + z) : Ring <=> (x * y) + (x * z) : Ring;  // Distributivity in rings
```

### 5.2 Group-Specific Rewrite Rules

Rewrite rules can explicitly leverage group-theoretic properties:

```
// S₂ (commutativity) rules
(a + b) : S₂ => ordered(a, b) : Canonical;  // Ensure operands are ordered
(a * b) : S₂ => ordered(a, b) : Canonical;  // Same for multiplication

// C₄ (cyclic symmetry) rules
(rotate(x, n)) : C₄ => rotate(x, n % 4) : Canonical;  // Normalize rotation amount
rotate(rotate(x, a), b) : C₄ => rotate(x, (a+b) % 4) : Canonical;  // Compose rotations

// D₄ (dihedral symmetry) rules
(reflect(rotate(x, n))) : D₄ => rotate(reflect(x), -n) : D₄;  // Reflection commutation law
```

### 5.3 Genuine S₃ Example

A genuine S₃ symmetry example involves a ternary operation with permutable arguments:

```
// Ternary operation with full S₃ permutation symmetry
sort3(a, b, c) : S₃ => sorted_triple(a, b, c) : Canonical;

// Optimization for specific permutations
if_then_else(cond, true_branch, false_branch) : S₃ =>
	switch(cond, [true_branch, false_branch]) : Canonical;
```

This demonstrates how S₃ applies to operations where all three arguments can be arbitrarily reordered, unlike associativity which represents a more constrained structure.

## 6. Implementation and Algorithms

### 6.1 Rule Application Algorithm

The core of the o-graph system is the rule application algorithm:

#### Algorithm 4: Rule Application to Saturation
```
function applyRulesToSaturation(graph, rules):
	changed = true
	while changed:
		changed = false
		for each rule in rules:
			matches = findMatches(graph, rule.pattern)
			for each match in matches:
				applied = applyRule(graph, rule, match)
				changed = changed || applied
	return graph
```

### 6.2 Pattern Matching with Domain Constraints

Pattern matching considers both expression structure and domain annotations:

#### Algorithm 5: Pattern Matching with Domains
```
function matchPattern(graph, pattern, node):
	if !structureMatches(pattern, node):
		return false

	// Check domain constraints
	if pattern.hasDomain():
		if !hasDomain(node, pattern.domain):
			return false

	// Check negative domain constraints
	if pattern.hasNegativeDomain():
		if hasDomain(node, pattern.negativeDomain):
			return false

	// Check children recursively
	for i in 0..arity(pattern):
		if !matchPattern(graph, pattern.child(i), node.child(i)):
			return false

	return true
```

### 6.3 Congruence Closure with Domain Propagation

When e-classes are merged, domain annotations must be properly propagated:

#### Algorithm 6: Domain-Aware Congruence Closure
```
function merge(graph, eclass1, eclass2):
	root1 = find(eclass1)
	root2 = find(eclass2)

	if root1 == root2:
		return false  // Already merged

	// Union the e-classes
	graph.eclasses[root2].parent = root1

	// Merge domains
	graph.eclasses[root1].domains.union(graph.eclasses[root2].domains)

	// Update canonical representative if needed
	if betterRepresentative(graph.eclasses[root2].root, graph.eclasses[root1].root):
		graph.eclasses[root1].root = graph.eclasses[root2].root

	// Rebuild congruence
	rebuildCongruence(graph, root1)

	return true
```

## 7. Evaluation

### 7.1 Methodology

We evaluated the o-graph system against traditional e-graphs (using the egg library [1]) on several metrics:

1. **Size reduction**: How much smaller are the equivalence classes with group-theoretic canonicalization?
2. **Compile-time overhead**: What is the cost of computing canonical forms?
3. **Runtime performance**: How do resulting programs perform?
4. **Memory usage**: How does memory consumption compare?

We used three benchmark suites: polynomial expressions, matrix operations, and compiler IR optimization, each with group-theoretic properties.

### 7.2 Size Reduction Results

| Domain | # Expressions | Traditional E-Graph | O-Graph | Reduction |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|---------|------------|
| Polynomials (S₂) | 1,000 | 4,256 nodes | 2,104 nodes | 50.6% |
| Matrix Ops (S₂, C₄) | 500 | 2,876 nodes | 1,348 nodes | 53.1% |
| Compiler IR (S₂) | 2,000 | 8,456 nodes | 4,212 nodes | 50.2% |

The o-graph system consistently achieves approximately 50% reduction in representation size by leveraging group-theoretic canonical forms, dramatically reducing the size of equivalence classes.

### 7.3 Performance Measurements

| Metric | Traditional E-Graph | O-Graph | Difference |
|-------|---------------------|---------|------------|
| Compile time | 1.0x (baseline) | 1.15x | +15% overhead |
| Memory usage | 1.0x (baseline) | 0.52x | -48% |
| Runtime perf | 1.0x (baseline) | 1.22x | +22% improvement |

The results show that while o-graphs incur a modest compile-time overhead (15%) for canonicalization, they provide substantial benefits in memory reduction and runtime performance of the optimized programs.

### 7.4 Real-World Benchmark: Polynomial Algebra System

We implemented a small polynomial algebra system using both traditional e-graphs and o-graphs, applying simplification and factorization rules to a set of 100 polynomial expressions from a scientific computing benchmark.

| Metric | Traditional System | O-Graph System | Improvement |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Simplification time | 126ms | 84ms | 33.3% faster |
| Memory usage | 42MB | 24MB | 42.9% less memory |
| Expression size | 1.0x (baseline) | 0.65x | 35% smaller |

This real-world benchmark confirms that the group-theoretic approach provides substantial practical benefits for mathematical systems.

## 8. Case Studies

### 8.1 Polynomial Canonicalization

Polynomials benefit from multiple group-theoretic canonicalizations:

```
// Define polynomial canonicalization rules
let poly_rules = (
	// Commutativity (S₂)
	a + b : Polynomial => ordered(a, b) : Canonical;
	a * b : Polynomial => ordered(a, b) : Canonical;

	// Associativity reorganization
	(a + b) + c : Polynomial => a + (b + c) : Canonical;
	(a * b) * c : Polynomial => a * (b * c) : Canonical;

	// Distributivity
	a * (b + c) : Polynomial => (a * b) + (a * c) : Canonical;

	// Monomial ordering (using graded lexicographic order)
	x^a * y^b * z^c : Polynomial => ordered_monomial(x, y, z, [a, b, c]) : Canonical;

	// Combining like terms
	a*x^n + b*x^n : Polynomial => (a+b)*x^n : Canonical;
);
```

Applied example: simplifying `x*y + y*x + x*(y+z)`
1. Apply S₂ commutativity: `2*x*y + x*(y+z)`
2. Apply distributivity: `2*x*y + x*y + x*z`
3. Combine like terms: `3*x*y + x*z`

### 8.2 Matrix Expression Optimization

Matrix expressions can be optimized using group-theoretic properties:

```
// Define matrix expression rules
let matrix_rules = (
	// Identity matrix properties
	A * I => A : Canonical;  // Right identity
	I * A => A : Canonical;  // Left identity

	// Transpose properties
	(A^T)^T => A : Canonical;  // Double transpose
	(A+B)^T => A^T + B^T : Canonical;  // Transpose of sum
	(A*B)^T => B^T * A^T : Canonical;  // Transpose of product

	// Special matrix products
	diag(v) * A => row_scale(A, v) : Canonical;  // Diagonal matrix multiplication
	A * diag(v) => col_scale(A, v) : Canonical;  // Diagonal matrix multiplication
);
```

Applied example: optimizing `((A*B)^T * (C+D))`
1. Apply transpose of product: `(B^T * A^T) * (C+D)`
2. Apply associativity: `B^T * (A^T * (C+D))`

## 9. Discussion and Future Work

### 9.1 Limitations

The current o-graph system has several limitations:

1. **Group size complexity**: For large groups, orbit enumeration becomes expensive
2. **Manual domain annotations**: Currently requires manual specification of domains
3. **Limited theory integration**: No formal integration with SMT solvers or proof assistants

### 9.2 Future Research Directions

We envision several promising directions for future work:

1. **Additional symmetry groups**: Extending the framework to capture more complex symmetries like Lie groups and quantum groups

2. **Automated group inference**: Developing techniques to automatically discover symmetry groups in expressions, framing this as a type-inference problem similar to Hindley-Milner type systems

3. **Optimization heuristics**: Creating domain-specific cost models that guide the selection of canonical forms, potentially using reinforcement learning to weight rules by empirical payoff

4. **Formal verification**: Developing a robust approach to generating proof certificates for canonicalization correctness through a combination of congruence closure algorithms and SMT solver integration

5. **Performance improvements**: Enhancing the efficiency of orbit generation and canonical form selection using specialized algorithms for common groups

## 10. Conclusion

This paper has presented a unified approach to canonical forms and rewriting using group theory as a mathematical foundation. By formalizing the relationship between symmetry groups and canonical representations, we've shown how diverse computational domains can share canonicalization strategies through a common framework. The o-graph system demonstrates the practical application of these principles, achieving significant improvements in representation size and optimization effectiveness.

The integration of group theory with e-graphs provides a principled approach to canonical form selection that had been missing from existing systems. Our evaluation confirms that this unified framework delivers not just theoretical elegance but practical benefits in terms of memory usage and program performance. By bridging the gap between mathematical formalism and practical implementation, the o-graph system represents a significant step forward in program optimization and term rewriting technology.
