# Mathematical Algorithm Speedups Through Identity Exploitation and Domain Specialization

## Introduction

Mathematical algorithms often experience dramatic performance improvements when we leverage specific algebraic identities, domain-specific properties, or apply constraints to restrict the problem space. This document explores how Orbit's e-graph architecture with canonical forms provides a powerful framework for automatically discovering and applying these optimizations through saturation of rewrite rules.

Just as Orbit can automatically derive FFT from DFT by exploiting cyclic group symmetries, similar transformations can be applied to many other algorithms. The key insight is that by saturating the e-graph with all known identities and algebraic properties, optimal algorithms can emerge naturally from the rewriting process without requiring explicit decision procedures.

## The E-Graph Advantage for Algorithm Discovery

Orbit's e-graph architecture with canonical forms provides two fundamental advantages that make automatic algorithm discovery possible:

### 1. Exponential Reduction Through Structure Sharing

E-graphs avoid combinatorial explosion by representing multiple equivalent expressions in a shared structure:

```orbit
// Consider n expressions with multiple equivalent forms
// Traditional approach: Store all versions separately (exponential space)
// E-graph approach: Represent equivalence classes with shared structure

// Example: Equivalent ways to compute a sum
a + b + c + d : Associative;  // Could be parsed many ways
a + (b + (c + d));
((a + b) + c) + d;
(a + b) + (c + d);
// All represented as a single e-class in the e-graph
```

### 2. Exponential Reduction Through Canonical Forms

Canonical forms select a single representative from each equivalence class, enabling efficient pattern matching:

```orbit
// Without canonicalization: Need to match all n! permutations
a + b + c + d : Commutative;
a + b + c + d;
b + a + c + d;
a + c + b + d;
// ... (24 total permutations)

// With canonicalization: Match only the canonical form
a + b + c + d : Commutative → do_something(a + b + c + d);
// Only need to match against the canonical form
```

### 3. Emergent Algorithms Through Rule Saturation

Instead of encoding decision procedures for algorithm selection, Orbit applies all possible rules and lets optimal algorithms emerge naturally:

``` orbit
// Orbit approach: Apply all relevant rules and let e-graph find optimal implementation
// multiply(A, B) : Matrix;
A * B : Matrix → standard_multiply(A, B);  // Basic implementation
A * B : LargeMatrix → strassen_multiply(A, B);  // Optimization rule
A * B : DiagonalMatrix → diagonal_multiply(A, B);  // Structure-specific rule
// The e-graph contains all equivalent implementations, but the most precise one will be the canonical choice
```

## Automatic Propagation of Domain Properties

A key strength of Orbit is the ability to automatically detect and propagate domain-specific properties, which then trigger specialized optimizations:

```orbit
// Domain detection and propagation
A : Matrix, is_triangular(A) ⊢ A : TriangularMatrix;  // Property detection
A : TriangularMatrix, B : TriangularMatrix ⊢ (A * B) : TriangularMatrix;  // Property propagation

// Property-triggered optimizations
A * B : TriangularMatrix → triangular_multiply(A, B);  // Specialized algorithm
inverse(A) : TriangularMatrix → triangular_inverse(A);  // O(n²) algorithm
```

This allows Orbit to discover domain-specific optimizations without explicitly encoding algorithm selection logic. The domain properties flow through the computation graph, triggering optimizations wherever applicable.

## Cross-Domain Synergies Through Group-Theoretic Bridging

### Mathematical Structures as Bridges Between Domains

One of the most powerful aspects of Orbit's approach is the ability to establish bridges between different mathematical domains using group theory and algebraic structures. This enables applying optimizations from one domain to problems in another domain:

```orbit
// Bridge between graph theory and linear algebra
G : Graph ↔ adjacency_matrix(G) : Matrix;  // Bidirectional transformation

// Bridge between polynomials and vectors
p : Polynomial ↔ coefficient_vector(p) : Vector;  // Bidirectional transformation

// Bridge between groups and permutations
g : Group ↔ permutation_representation(g) : Permutation;  // Bidirectional transformation
```

These bridges allow optimizations to flow across domain boundaries, potentially unlocking algorithms that wouldn't be obvious in the original domain.

### Transformations Between Representation Domains

Problems can often be transformed between different representation domains to leverage specialized algorithms:

```orbit
// Graph coloring via transformation to SAT
graph_coloring(G, k) : GraphColoring ↔ sat_encoding(G, k) : SatisfiabilityProblem;  // Transform to SAT

// Polynomial system solving via transformation to matrix
solve_poly_system(eqs) : PolynomialSystem ↔ macaulay_matrix(eqs) : LinearAlgebra;  // Transform to linear algebra

// Convex optimization via transformation to geometric programming
optimize(f, constraints) : ConvexProblem ↔ geometric_program(f, constraints) : GeometricProgramming;  // Transform to geometric programming
```

These transformations act as "wormholes" between domains, allowing problems to be solved using the most effective techniques from each domain.

## Tabulation-Based Optimizations in Fixed-Size Domains

### Complete Tabulation in Z₈/C₈

For small finite groups like Z₈ (integers modulo 8) or C₈ (cyclic group of order 8), complete tabulation of all operations becomes a practical optimization technique:

```orbit
// Recognize 8-bit integer operations as operations in Z₈
(a + b) : Int8 → (a + b) : Z_8;  // Modular addition
(a * b) : Int8 → (a * b) : Z_8;  // Modular multiplication

// Tabulation-based optimizations for Z₈ operations
(a + b) : Z_8 → addition_table_lookup(a, b) : Tabulated;  // O(1) lookup
(a * b) : Z_8 → multiplication_table_lookup(a, b) : Tabulated;  // O(1) lookup

// Precomputed tables (feasible because only 256×256 entries for 8-bit integers)
initialize_tables() → (
	addition_table = [[(i + j) % 256 for j in 0..255] for i in 0..255];
	multiplication_table = [[(i * j) % 256 for j in 0..255] for i in 0..255];
);
```

These tabulation optimizations can then be applied automatically whenever operations are recognized as occurring in Z₈/C₈, without the need for explicit algorithm selection.

## Linear Algebra Algorithms

### Matrix Multiplication

Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication emerges from the saturation of rules for matrix partitioning and algebraic manipulation:

```orbit
// Basic matrix multiplication definition
A * B : Matrix → standard_multiply(A, B) : MatrixProduct;

// Block matrix multiplication rules
partition(A, 2, 2) * partition(B, 2, 2) ↔ block_multiply(A, B) : MatrixProduct;

// Strassen's optimization emerges from algebraic rewriting
block_multiply(A, B) : MatrixProduct : LargeMatrix → (
	// The Strassen identity automatically emerges from algebraic simplifications
	// in the e-graph through rewrite rule saturation
	let [A₁₁, A₁₂, A₂₁, A₂₂] = partition(A, 2, 2);
	let [B₁₁, B₁₂, B₂₁, B₂₂] = partition(B, 2, 2);

	let M₁ = (A₁₁ + A₂₂) * (B₁₁ + B₂₂);
	let M₂ = (A₂₁ + A₂₂) * B₁₁;
	let M₃ = A₁₁ * (B₁₂ - B₂₂);
	let M₄ = A₂₂ * (B₂₁ - B₁₁);
	let M₅ = (A₁₁ + A₁₂) * B₂₂;
	let M₆ = (A₂₁ - A₁₁) * (B₁₁ + B₁₂);
	let M₇ = (A₁₂ - A₂₂) * (B₂₁ + B₂₂);

	let C₁₁ = M₁ + M₄ - M₅ + M₇;
	let C₁₂ = M₃ + M₅;
	let C₂₁ = M₂ + M₄;
	let C₂₂ = M₁ - M₂ + M₃ + M₆;

	combine([C₁₁, C₁₂, C₂₁, C₂₂])
);
```

TODO: Define what partition and combine do. Also define how triangular matrix multiply exploits some group-theoretic structure or algebraic identitiets.

The key difference in Orbit's approach is that Strassen's algorithm can emerge from rewrite rule saturation rather than being explicitly encoded as a separate algorithm.

### Fast Matrix Inversion

Matrix inversion optimizations emerge from domain-specific properties:

```orbit
// General matrix inversion
inverse(M) : Matrix → general_inverse(M) : Inverse;

// Domain-specific optimizations emerge automatically
M : DiagonalMatrix ⊢ inverse(M) → diagonal_inverse(M);  // O(n) algorithm
M : TriangularMatrix ⊢ inverse(M) → triangular_inverse(M);  // O(n²) algorithm
M : OrthogonalMatrix ⊢ inverse(M) → transpose(M);  // M⁻¹ = Mᵀ
M : ToeplitzMatrix ⊢ inverse(M) → toeplitz_inverse(M);  // Specialized algorithm
```

TODO: We need to dig a step down and find out how these specialized inversed can be derived, because if Orbit can do that, we have a much more robust system which can maybe find new optimized algorithms for hybrid cases.

## Number Theory & Arithmetic Algorithms

### Fast Integer Multiplication

Karatsuba's algorithm emerges from algebraic identities and recursive patterns:

```orbit
// Basic integer multiplication
multiply(a, b) : Integer → standard_multiply(a, b);

// Algebraic splitting for large integers
multiply(a, b) : Integer : LargeInteger → (
	// Split numbers: a = a₁·10^m + a₀, b = b₁·10^m + b₀
	let m = max(digits(a), digits(b)) / 2;
	let [a₁, a₀] = split_at_digit(a, m);
	let [b₁, b₀] = split_at_digit(b, m);

	// Key Karatsuba identity emerges from algebraic expansion in the e-graph
	let z₀ = multiply(a₀, b₀);  // Low parts
	let z₂ = multiply(a₁, b₁);  // High parts
	let z₁ = multiply(a₁ + a₀, b₁ + b₀) - z₂ - z₀;  // Middle part

	z₂ * 10^(2*m) + z₁ * 10^m + z₀
);
```

TODO: What is split_at_digits?

The e-graph saturation naturally discovers that computing (a₁+a₀)(b₁+b₀) - a₁b₁ - a₀b₀ requires only 3 multiplications instead of 4, leading to Karatsuba's algorithm.

### Fast Exponentiation

Binary exponentiation emerges from algebraic identities:

```orbit
// Basic exponentiation definition
power(x, n) : AlgebraicOperation → x * power(x, n-1) if n > 0;  // Recursive definition
power(x, 0) : AlgebraicOperation → 1;  // Base case

// These identities lead to binary exponentiation through e-graph saturation
power(x, 2*k) ↔ power(x^2, k);  // Square-and-multiply identity
power(x, 2*k+1) ↔ x * power(x^2, k) : PowerIdentity;  // Odd exponent identity
```

When these rules saturate the e-graph, the binary exponentiation algorithm naturally emerges as the optimal implementation without needing an explicit decision procedure.

## Polynomial Algorithms

### Polynomial Evaluation

Horner's method emerges from algebraic rearrangement:

```orbit
// Basic polynomial evaluation
eval_poly(coeffs, x) : Polynomial → sum([coeffs[i] * x^i for i in 0..n]) : PolynomialValue;

// Algebraic rearrangement leads to Horner's method
coeffs[0] + x * coeffs[1] + x^2 * coeffs[2] + ... + x^n * coeffs[n] ↔
coeffs[0] + x * (coeffs[1] + x * (coeffs[2] + ... + x * coeffs[n]...)) : Horner;
```

The nested form of Horner's method emerges naturally from algebraic rearrangement in the e-graph, reducing from O(n²) to O(n) operations.

### Fast Polynomial Multiplication via FFT

The FFT-based fast polynomial multiplication emerges as a special case of the convolution transformation:

```orbit
// Basic polynomial multiplication (convolution of coefficients)
multiply_poly(p, q) : Polynomial → convolution(p, q) : Product;

// Domain transformation rules
convolution(p, q) : Transform ↔ ifft(fft(p) * fft(q)) : FrequencyDomain;  // Transform to frequency domain
fft(p) : C_n → butterfly_fft(p) if is_power_of_2(length(p));  // Apply FFT optimization
```

Through rule saturation, the e-graph discovers that polynomial multiplication can be implemented efficiently through FFT, reducing complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n).

## Specialized Representations for Computation Domains

Another powerful aspect of Orbit's approach is the ability to leverage specialized representations for different computation domains. This enables performance gains by matching the representation to the computation's needs:

```orbit
// Dense vector operations
v + w : DenseVector → dense_vector_add(v, w);
v * w : DenseVector → dense_vector_multiply(v, w);

// Sparse vector operations
v + w : SparseVector → sparse_vector_add(v, w);
v * w : SparseVector → sparse_vector_multiply(v, w);

// Compressed sparse row matrix operations
A * v : CSRMatrix → csr_matrix_vector_multiply(A, v);
```

The insights from one representation can influence optimizations in another:

```orbit
// Bridge between computation domains allows cross-domain learning
A : DenseMatrix, is_mostly_zeros(A) ⊢ convert(A, SparseMatrix) : Optimization;
v : SparseVector, is_mostly_nonzeros(v) ⊢ convert(v, DenseVector) : Optimization;
```

This ability to fluidly move between different representations based on computational properties leads to algorithms that can adapt to the specific characteristics of the input data.

## Fast Transforms and Spectral Methods

### Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT)

Fast WHT emerges from the same divide-and-conquer pattern as FFT:

```orbit
// Basic Walsh-Hadamard Transform definition
wht(x) : Transform → [sum([x[j] * (-1)^(bit_count(j&i)) for j in 0..n-1]) for i in 0..n-1] : WHT;

// Pattern for recursive decomposition
wht(x) : Transform : RecursiveSplittable → (
	let n = length(x);
	if n == 1 then
		x
	else (
		let even = x[0:n:2];  // Even indices
		let odd = x[1:n:2];    // Odd indices

		let wht_even = wht(even);
		let wht_odd = wht(odd);

		concat(wht_even + wht_odd, wht_even - wht_odd)
	)
);
```

The saturation of the recursive pattern naturally leads to the emergence of fast WHT algorithm with O(n log n) complexity.

## Matrix Factorization Algorithms

### QR Factorization Specializations

Specialized QR algorithms emerge from matrix structure detection:

```orbit
// Basic QR factorization
qr_factorize(A) : Matrix → householder_qr(A) : QRFactorization;

// Domain-specific optimizations emerge automatically
A : TridiagonalMatrix ⊢ qr_factorize(A) → tridiagonal_qr(A);  // O(n) algorithm
A : BandMatrix ⊢ qr_factorize(A) → band_qr(A);  // Structure-specific algorithm
A : OrthogonalMatrix ⊢ qr_factorize(A) → (A, I);  // Trivial factorization
```

## Numerical Methods

### Differential Equation Solvers

Optimized ODE solvers emerge from system property detection:

```orbit
// Basic ODE solver
solve_ode(system, initial, t_span) : ODE → rk4_method(system, initial, t_span) : Solution;

// Domain-specific optimizations emerge automatically
system : StiffSystem ⊢ solve_ode(system, initial, t_span) → implicit_method(system, initial, t_span);
system : HamiltonianSystem ⊢ solve_ode(system, initial, t_span) → symplectic_integrator(system, initial, t_span);
system : OscillatorySystem ⊢ solve_ode(system, initial, t_span) → oscillatory_solver(system, initial, t_span);
```

### Fast Multipole Method

The Fast Multipole Method emerges from the application of approximation rules to n-body interactions:

```orbit
// Basic n-body interaction computation
compute_interactions(particles) : NBodyProblem → (
	// Direct computation: O(n²)
	[sum([force(particle, other) for other in particles if other != particle]) for particle in particles]
) : DirectComputation;

// Hierarchical approximation rules
compute_interactions(particles) : NBodyProblem : Hierarchical → (
	// Build hierarchical tree
	let tree = build_octree(particles);

	// Apply hierarchical approximation
	[compute_particle_force(particle, tree) for particle in particles]
);

// Rules for approximating distant interactions
force(p, q) : Interaction : DistantInteraction → multipole_approximation(p, q) : Approximated;
```

These rules enable the automatic emergence of O(n) algorithms for n-body simulations instead of the naive O(n²) approach.

## The Power of Saturation-Based Algorithm Discovery

Unlike traditional approaches that explicitly encode algorithm selection logic, Orbit's saturation-based approach offers several advantages:

### 3. Cross-Domain Optimization Opportunities

Saturation allows optimizations to apply across domain boundaries, finding unexpected connections:

```orbit
// Polynomial convolution can use FFT
convolve(p, q) : Polynomial ↔ ifft(fft(p) * fft(q));

// String matching can use FFT for certain patterns
pattern_match(text, pattern) : RepeatingPattern → fft_based_match(text, pattern);

// Image processing can use FFT for large convolutions
image_convolve(image, kernel) : LargeKernel → fft_convolution(image, kernel);

// Graph spectral algorithms can use matrix decompositions
graph_spectral_clustering(G) : Graph → svd_clustering(adjacency_matrix(G)) : LinearAlgebra;
```

### 4. Automatic Algorithm Derivation

By saturating the e-graph with mathematical identities and rewrite rules, entirely new algorithms can be derived automatically:

```orbit
// Starting with naive matrix multiplication: O(n³)
matrix_multiply(A, B) → [sum([A[i][k] * B[k][j] for k in 0..n-1]) for i in 0..n-1, j in 0..n-1];

// Through saturation with algebraic identities and recursion patterns
// Strassen's algorithm can emerge: O(n^2.807)
```

This is precisely how Orbit could automatically derive FFT from DFT, Karatsuba from standard multiplication, and potentially discover other algorithmic improvements.
