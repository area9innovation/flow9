# Orbit TODO List (Prioritized)

## ðŸ”´ Priority 1: Core S-Expression Backend & Rewriting Feasibility

**Focus:** Ensure the S-expression based interpreter and rewriting engine are functional and validate the core canonicalization mechanism. Retire the old Orbit interpreter.

*   **S-Expression Backend Migration:**
    âœ“   **Verify Orbit <-> S-Expression Conversion Integrity:**
        *   Run: `./run_orbit_tests.sh --sexpr-roundtrip`
        *   Goal: Ensure all tests pass the integrity check, meaning the `orbit sexpr-roundtrip=1` mode reports "SUCCESS" for the Orbit -> SExpr -> Orbit -> SExpr conversion process. Investigate any failures reported in the `.sexpr_roundtrip.log` files. This step checks the *conversion mechanism* itself, not the execution results.
		  - imports are dropped. Fine
		  - We use [] instead of (). Fine
		  - ast annotation is lost. Fine.
		  - x : P(x) is parsed as (x : P)(x) and that gives problems
    *   **Verify S-Expression Engine Execution Equivalence:**
        *   Run: `./run_orbit_tests.sh --compare-engines`
        *   Goal: Ensure all tests produce identical *execution output* between the default engine and the S-expression engine (`sexpr=1`). Address any discrepancies found in the `.engine_diff` files. This confirms the S-expression backend *runs* code equivalently.
		    - and, or, not instead of c syntax
			- `not` instead of Â¬
			- ERROR: matchOGraphSexprPattern callback must be a lambda
			- dft_test: unquote
			âœ“ evalWithBindings is missing
			âœ“ find_ograph_id_test findOGraphId is missing
			- fun is strange
			- fun2: ERROR: addSexprWithSub third argument must be a list of bindings
			- tree: undefined name key, value...
    *   **O-Graph S-Expression Integration:** Modify O-Graph internal representation to primarily use S-Expressions or have seamless S-Expression interoperability. Test basic O-Graph operations (add, extract) using `tests/ograph_basic.orb` (if exists) with `--sexpr` and check results (or use `--compare-engines`).
    *   **Validate Rewriting Engine:**
        *   Run: `./run_orbit_tests.sh --compare-engines` on core rewriting tests (e.g., `tests/rewrite.orb`, `tests/pattern.orb`, `tests/algebra.orb` - adjust names based on actual files).
        *   Goal: Ensure identical execution results. Fix any differences reported by the comparison.
        *   Also run specific rewriting tests using only the SExpr engine: `./run_orbit_tests.sh --sexpr tests/rewrite.orb` and verify output.
    *   **Implement Basic Evaluation:** Implement evaluation for simple conditions (e.g., `<`, `>`, arithmetic) within the S-Expression based O-Graph/rewriting context. Test with rules using `if` conditions (e.g., `tests/conditional_rewrite.orb`), checking results with `--sexpr`.
    *   **Implement Minimal Environment:** Implement basic environment handling for scoped variables (e.g., function parameters, let bindings, summation indices) within the S-Expression evaluator. Test with `tests/scopes.orb`, `tests/lambda.orb`, or tests involving summations, checking results with `--sexpr`.
*   **Core O-Graph Rewriting & Canonicalization (using S-Expr backend):**
    *   **Implement & Test `Sâ‚‚` Canonicalization:**
        *   Run: `./run_orbit_tests.sh --sexpr tests/commutativity.orb` (or similar test).
        *   Goal: Verify sorting/canonicalization via `mergeOGraphNodes` and `Sâ‚‚` rules works correctly by checking the output.
    *   **Implement & Test `Câ‚™` Canonicalization:**
        *   Run: `./run_orbit_tests.sh --sexpr tests/cyclic.orb` (or similar test using `booth_canonical`).
        *   Goal: Verify Booth's algorithm implementation via rules/functions linked to `: Câ‚™` by checking the output.
    *   **Verify `addOGraphWithSub` / `matchOGraphPattern`:**
        *   Run: `./run_orbit_tests.sh --sexpr tests/ograph_subst.orb` (or similar).
        *   Goal: Ensure robust handling of S-Expression bindings and substitutions in pattern matching and rewriting by checking the output.
    *   **Verify `gather`/`scatter`:**
        *   Run: `./run_orbit_tests.sh --sexpr tests/gather_scatter.orb` (or similar).
        *   Goal: Ensure array-based representation works correctly with pattern matching for associative ops by checking the output.
*   **Simple Derivation Example (using S-Expr backend):**
    *   Implement rewrite rules for Horner's method derivation *OR* initial FFT split rules.
    *   Create a specific test file (e.g., `tests/horner_derivation.orb` or `tests/fft_split.orb`).
    *   Run: `./run_orbit_tests.sh --sexpr tests/your_derivation_test.orb`
    *   Goal: Verify `applyRulesUntilFixedPoint` successfully transforms the expression using the S-expression backend by checking the output.

## ðŸŸ¡ Priority 2: Expand Core Functionality & Algorithms
