Creating ograph...

Test 1: Addition with zero

Inserting expression into ograph
Original expression: expr1
Applying simplification rules to AST
Simplified expression: expr
Added to ograph with nodeId: 1
Variable not found: b2s
Cannot call non-function value: 0
Expected int, double, string or array for +, not true
Added domain 'Simplified': 

Test 2: Multiplication by zero

Inserting expression into ograph
Original expression: expr2
Applying simplification rules to AST
Simplified expression: expr
Added to ograph with nodeId: 3
Variable not found: b2s
Cannot call non-function value: 0
Expected int, double, string or array for +, not true
Added domain 'Simplified': 

Test 3: General addition

Inserting expression into ograph
Original expression: expr3
Applying simplification rules to AST
Simplified expression: expr
Added to ograph with nodeId: 5
Variable not found: b2s
Cannot call non-function value: 0
Expected int, double, string or array for +, not true
Added domain 'Simplified': 
Variable not found: b2s
Cannot call non-function value: 0
Expected int, double, string or array for +, not true
Added domain 'Canonical': 

Printing ograph:

Extracting node from ograph:
Extracted expression: "simplified"

Demonstrating pattern rule with ograph
Source expression: "simplified"
Created replacement node: 8
Variable not found: b2s
Cannot call non-function value: 0
Expected int, double, string or array for +, not true
Merged nodes: 

Final ograph after rule application:
Result: "Node 1 [math]: OrIdentifier\nNode 2 [meta]: domain\nNode 3 [math]: OrIdentifier\nNode 4 [meta]: domain\nNode 5 [math]: OrIdentifier\nNode 6 [meta]: domain\nNode 7 [meta]: domain\nNode 5 [math]: OrIdentifier\n"
