=== DFT Optimization Test ===
Original Sum Expression: sum(k, 0, 7, sum(j, 0, 7, (x[j] * twiddle(8, (j * k)))))
After Split Sum Rule: sum(k, 0, 7, sum(j, 0, 7, (x[j] * twiddle(8, (j * k)))))
Twiddle Factor Expression: twiddle(8, ((2 * j) * k))
After Twiddle Factor Rule: twiddle((8 / 2), (j * k))
Half-Period Expression: twiddle(8, (k + 4))
ERROR: Array index out of bounds: 1 (array length: 1)
ERROR: Array index out of bounds: 2 (array length: 1)
After Half-Period Rule: twiddle(8, (k + 4))
Original DFT Expression: dft(x, 8, k)
Variable not found: create_dft_rules
Cannot call non-function value: 0
ERROR: Expected array in arrayLength, got OrInt
Fully Optimized Expression: dft(x, 8, k)
Result: "DFT optimization tests completed."
