=== Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) Tests ===
--- Basic BDD Construction ---
x as BDD:
Ite(x, true, false)
!x as BDD:
Ite(x, false, true)
--- Boolean Operations ---
x && y as BDD:
Ite(x, Ite(y, true, false), false)
x || y as BDD:
Ite(x, true, Ite(y, true, false))
--- Conditional Expressions (Shannon Expansion) ---
Multiplexer (s?a:b): ((s ∧ a) ∨ (¬s ∧ b))
As BDD (should be Ite(s, a, b)):
Ite(a, Ite(b, true, Ite(s, true, false)), Ite(b, Ite(s, false, true), false))
--- BDD to Logic Conversion ---
Multiplexer BDD back to logic:
((a ∧ (b ∨ s)) ∨ (¬a ∧ (b ∧ ¬s)))
--- Logical Equivalence Testing ---
De Morgan's Law: !(x && y) == !x || !y
Equivalent: 1
Distributivity: a && (b || c) == (a && b) || (a && c)
Equivalent: 1
XOR Equivalence: (a && !b) || (!a && b) == (a || b) && (!a || !b)
Equivalent: 1
--- Comparison with Other Normal Forms ---
Test expression: ((a ∧ b) ∨ (¬a ∧ c))
As BDD:
Ite(a, Ite(b, true, false), Ite(c, true, false))
As CNF:
(((a ∨ c) ∧ (b ∨ c)) ∧ (b ∨ ¬a))
As DNF:
((a ∧ b) ∨ (¬a ∧ c))
Equivalence between forms:
BDD ≡ CNF: 1
BDD ≡ DNF: 1
CNF ≡ DNF: 1
Result: "CNF ≡ DNF: 1"
