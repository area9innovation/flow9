==== Testing DNF Canonicalization ====
Original: ((a ∨ b) ∧ (¬a ∨ c))
Rule 'special_dnf_case' applied. ID: 12: ((a ∧ c) ∨ (¬a ∧ b)) was ((a ∨ b) ∧ (¬a ∨ c)) at 8
To DNF: ((a ∧ c) ∨ (¬a ∧ b))
Rule 'special_dnf_case' applied. ID: 12: ((a ∧ c) ∨ (¬a ∧ b)) was ((a ∨ b) ∧ (¬a ∨ c)) at 8
Normalized (before gather/scatter): ((a ∧ c) ∨ (¬a ∧ b))
Result: "Done"
