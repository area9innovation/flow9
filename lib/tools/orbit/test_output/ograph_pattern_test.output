Adding expressions to the graph...
Expression IDs:
10 + 20 = ID 1
5 * 6 = ID 2
(7 + 8) * 9 = ID 3
a + b = ID 4
a * c = ID 5
(a + b) * c = ID 6
Test 1: Matching pattern x + y
Variable not found: x
Variable not found: y
Found 0 matches for pattern 'x + y'
Test 2: Matching pattern 5 * z
Variable not found: z
Found 0 matches for pattern '5 * z'
Test 3: Matching pattern (x + y) * z
Variable not found: x
Variable not found: y
Variable not found: z
Found 0 matches for pattern '(x + y) * z'
Test 4: Matching pattern x + x (same variable twice)
Variable not found: x
Variable not found: x
Found 0 matches for pattern 'x + x'
Added expression a + a = ID 7
Test 5: Matching pattern x + x again
Variable not found: x
Variable not found: x
Found 0 matches for pattern 'x + x'
Pattern matching test completed
Result: 0
