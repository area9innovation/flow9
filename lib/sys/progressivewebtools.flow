	// A service worker is a script which your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction.

	// Browsers support map: http://caniuse.com/#search=service%20worker
	// EXAMPLE: flow/sandbox/serviceworker.flow
	// LIVE EXAMPLE: https://tech.area9innovation.com/sw/flowjs.html?name=test_sw

	// Functionality contained in this file is intended to manipulate implemented Service Worker for controlling FlowJS cache.
	// NOTE: Service Worker influences over all static resources with scope matching to files located lower than flowjs.html.
	// CAUTION: Service Worker keeps running behind the scene, despite of launches.
	// CAUTION: Service Worker runs only for pages served over HTTPS protocol.

	// Service Worker caches each launch request to static resources (all extensions, except .php & .serverbc).
	// Such way helps us to keep actual responses inside cache storage.
	// EXCEPTION: Only one particular php request is cached - it's the request to /php/stamp.php?file=<application>.js.
	// We do this to respond with the latest timestamp for <application>.js file in offline mode.

	// Once static resource request fails (user is offline, etc.) we respond to a client with previously cached resource.

	// Registers the Service Worker for a web page.
	// Once called the Service Worker will be run until disableServiceWorkerCaching called.
	native enableServiceWorkerCaching : io (callback : (success : bool) -> void) -> void = ProgressiveWebTools.registerCacheServiceWorker;

	// Unregisters the Service Worker from a web page.
	// Make sure to call after enableServiceWorkerCaching or checkServiceWorkerCachingEnabled callback called with true.
	// Disables Service Worker once any ongoing operation will be finished.
