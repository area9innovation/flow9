A mouse lived in a windmill in old Amsterdam,
A windmill with a mouse in and he wasn’t grousing.
He sang every morning, “How lucky I am
Living in a windmill in old Amsterdam!”

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:46.000
I saw a mouse! Where?
There on the stair.
Where on a stair?
Right there, a little mouse with clogs on,
Well I declare,
Going clip clippety clop on the stair.
Oh yeah!

The mouse he got lonesome, he took him a wife;
A windmill with mice in is hardly surprising,
She sang every morning, “How lucky I am
Living in a windmill in old Amsterdam!”

I saw a mouse! Where?
There on the stair.
Where on a stair?
Right there, a little mouse with clogs on,
Well I declare,
Going clip clippety clop on the stair.
Oh yeah!

First they had triplets and then they had quins,
A windmill with quins in, triplets and twins in.
They sang every morning, “How lucky we are
Living in a windmill in old Amsterdam, ya!”

I saw a mouse! Where?
There on the stair.
Where on a stair?
Right there, a little mouse with clogs on,
Well I declare,
Going clip clippety clop on the stair.
Oh yeah!
