 <strong>Tagging Best Practices</strong>
 <ul>
 <li>DO NOT use tags to record personally identifiable information.</li>
 <li>The best way to use tags is to create all the tag strings as predefined
 constants and only use those.  This is more efficient and removes the risk of
 collecting personal information.</li>
 <li>Do not set tags inside loops or any other place which gets called
 frequently.  This can cause a lot of data to be stored and uploaded.</li>

 <strong>Best Practices</strong>
 <ul>
 <li>Integrate Localytics in <code>applicationDidFinishLaunching</code>.</li>
 <li>Open your session and begin your uploads in <code>applicationDidBecomeActive</code>. This way the
 upload has time to complete and it all happens before your users have a
 chance to begin any data intensive actions of their own.</li>
 <li>Close the session in <code>applicationWillResignActive</code>.</li>
 <li>Do not call any Localytics functions inside a loop.  Instead, calls
 such as <code>tagEvent</code> should follow user actions.  This limits the
 amount of data which is stored and uploaded.</li>
 <li>Do not instantiate a Localtyics object, instead use only the exposed class methods.</li>
